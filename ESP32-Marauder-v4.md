# ESP32 Marauder v4
The ESP32 Marauder v4 is the original first iteration of the official ESP32 Marauder hardware. The hardware was designed specifically to function with the ESP32 Marauder firmware as it featured a 2.8" TFT ILI9341 touch capable display, ESP32-WROOM module, and a 3.7V LiPo charging and management circuit. 

The device can be interfaced through the 2.8" touch display where the user will have full access to the Marauder menu system and it's various WiFi and Bluetooth functions which are described in detail under the [specific functions list](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/applications) as well as the [workflow documentation](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki/workflow-examples).

To power the ESP32 Marauder v4, the user will be required to install a 3.7V LiPo battery with a 2mm pitch 2-pin JST connector. You must exercise caution when installing the battery as there is no standard for lead arrangement in JST housings and there is a chance the voltage and ground wires are arranged opposite to what is expected by the V4 hardware. You can check if the leads match the ESP32 Marauder v4 wiring by matching the red wire to the thick PCB trace coming off of one of the JST pins of the v4 hardware. If they do not match, you can use a pair of tweezers to reverse the wires in the housing. Power can also be applied to the v4 using a micro USB cable and any USB power supply as long as it can supply 5V.

With a battery connected, the v4 may be powered on with a single press of the power button located on the left side of the body. The Marauder will execute a small sequence of steps to check the hardware and initialize some of its functions then the main menu will be displayed. To power the device off, simply double press the same power button. If using USB power, the USB cable will have to be unplugged for the device to power off. The power button will not function.
