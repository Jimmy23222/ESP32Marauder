# Getting Started
The ESP32 Marauder firmware can be installed on a wide range of ESP32 hardware. In this repository, you will find precompiled binaries for a few specific pieces of hardware. If your hardware is not found or none of the binaries are compatible with your hardware setup, you will likely need to build the Marauder firmware from source. This page will point you in the right direction whether you're looking to build your own Marauder, install the firmware on existing hardware, or build the project from source. Please use the table below to figure out where you need to go.
